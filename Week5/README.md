#Task 1
Create a program that defines a struct named Point to represent a 2D point with integer coordinates X and Y. The program should demonstrate the following functionalities:

1. Declare a variable of type Point.
2. Assign values to the X and Y coordinates of the point.
3. Declare and initialize another variable of type Point.
4. Assign values to the coordinates of the second point.
5. Print out the coordinates of both points.


#Task 2
Create C# program with a generic class named Box<T> that can hold any type of data. The class should have the following functionalities:
1. A private data member to hold the value of type T.
2. A constructor that initializes the data member with a given value.
3. A method named GetValue that returns the stored value.
4. A method named SetValue that allows setting a new value to the data member.
Implement the above functionalities in the Box<T> class. Then, create instances of Box<T> with different types (e.g., int, double, string) and demonstrate the usage of the GetValue and SetValue methods.
